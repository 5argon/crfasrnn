# CRF-RNN for Semantic Image Segmentation

This fork adds things that I need for my research.
- Batch detect will convert lots of image and also time each conversion.
- Batch detect only output human as white, any other 20 labels will be black.

For more information about CRF-RNN please vist the project website http://crfasrnn.torr.vision.
